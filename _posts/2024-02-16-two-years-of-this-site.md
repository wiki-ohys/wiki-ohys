title: 'On Completing Two Years of this Wiki'

I finished reading OHYS winters of 2021-22, and after reading it, the idea of making a wiki struck me. This is February and the wiki has completed its two years. While it makes me sad that in two years, so little progress has been made, but it makes me happy as well that this wiki exists. 

This sluggish progress can be attributed to my studies and other business of my life, but I have regularly added one thing or another to the wiki. The template is almost complete, needing minor improvements like dark mode, search feature etc. The most important work which is pending is the actual writing of the wiki. Including details of characters, adding trivia etc. 

However, I'm about to get tons of time I hope, and I've decided that I'll at least enter details of all the characters and important events of the novel. Another important task is to create a page to list all the important events which happened all throughout the novel. It will be easy for the readers to navigate and explore individual events of the novel. The plot section of the wiki is also needing elaboration and detailing, which I'm aiming to complete soon. I hope I'll do justice to such a significant work and contribute to its greatness.
