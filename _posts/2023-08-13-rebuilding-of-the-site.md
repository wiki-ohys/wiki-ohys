### Beginning
There has been no work done in the site for more than a year now. I was busy in my masters program and whatnot, but now I have got time. I have learned how to use jekyll, which makes building static sites like this very easy. This makes me very confident in trying to rebuild this website using jekyll. 
### Current affairs
After abandoning this site for more than a year, I have now thought of at least rebuilding this site if not adding more content. Content will be added later. I always had problem with the way I was building this site and that is manually copy pasting the same code again and again on every page, and since this site is a wiki, so there are going to be thousands of pages.  
To make the process easy I learned jekyll and have started rebuilding this site using Jekyll. This is going to be a complex process because I have to port all the previously build pages and information into the new framework of this site. But slowly I will achieve this. I have not yet thought of styling the site rather only basic structuring but as I'll continue further, I will choose a pretty theme for the site as well. 
### Guide for you
Since I have rebuilt the site with Jekyll you'll find the site full of broken links and layouts, which is totally fine. I have started working on the blog section of the first because that's important to give you some news on what is going on. After that I'll focus on the characters page and about page of the website becasue that is foremost importance. And finally everything else will slowly fall into its place.  
Wish me luck!
