Hi, In this post I am going to talk about the idea behind this wiki. When I finished reading One Hundred Years of Solitude in January this year I was blown. It is such a wonderful book. It has a magic in itself and it is indeed a Magical Realism book. Marquez has really done an outstanding job with the book.

So, after reading the book I was searching the internet for a wiki where I can learn more about the book and the story. I find such lack of good wiki sites that it motivated me to create a wiki for it.

Currently, I am working on this site alone and also I am enrolled in a Masters degree program that's why I can't work on this site full time. But I will continue developing it. The basic structure of this site is ready and I can start putting details in it. Like the characters and incidents and other trivia.

I am so excited to do all this. If you want to help please <a href="https://twisthead.github.io/content/contact.html">contact me.</a>
