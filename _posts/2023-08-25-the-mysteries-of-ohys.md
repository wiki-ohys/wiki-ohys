### The book
OHYS is a immensely captivating book, I was took away by its magic as soon as I started reading it and it was back in the winter of 2021. Until now I was only heard of OHYS and the magic realism genre however, I read some books of this genre before for example, Haruki Murakami's 'Kafka on the shore' and 'Sputnik Sweetheart', and Salman Rushdie's "Haroun Rasheed and the sea of stories". They were fascinating books with something radically different from traditional books to tell. I read OHYS and found it no different.
