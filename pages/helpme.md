#### Start an issue on GitHub

This site is hosted on GitHub. You can report any glitch or your suggestions by starting an issue on the github repo page. This is the easiest and fastest method, but first you have to have a GitHub account first. <a href="https://github.com/wiki-ohys/wiki-ohys.github.io" target="_blank">Link to GitHub Repo</a>
#### Contribute using pull request on GitHub

If you want to add or amend some part of the website you can make pull requests to the site repo. This is again the easiest method to help, because then I'll merge that pull request to the repo and you've contributed to this wiki. But again, you must have the knowledge how to work on GitHub and how to make pull requests.

#### Contribute by contacting me

If you want to contribute alternatively by directly contacting me, you can do that also. You can <a href="https://twisthead.github.io/contact" target="_blank">Contact Me</a> I'll be glad to merge your contribution and also you'll be credited for your contribution in this site.
