[Ursula]({{ "/ursula/" | "relative_url" }}) fears that if she and her husband Jose Arcadio Buendia have a child, it will be born with a pig's tale because she and Jose Arcadio Buendia are cousins.

Her fear of a child born with pig's tale out fo incenstous relationship comes true in the last generation of Buendia family when [Aureliano Babilonia]({{ "/aurelianobabilonia/" | "relative_url"}}) and [Amaranta Ursula]({{ "/amarantaursula/" | "relative_url"}})'s son Aureliano is born with a pig's tale in result of their incestual relationship.
