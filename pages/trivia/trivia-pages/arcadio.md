description: All the fascinating details of Arcadio's of OHYS
---
1. There are total of five Arcadios in the seven generations of the Buendia family.
2. Arcadios are knwown for their enourmous physique and reckless behaviour.
3. Every Arcadio resembles each other, so much so that when Jose Arcadio Segundo started behaving like an Aureliano, Ursula was sure that they must've swiped in infancy, since they were born twins.
4. Arcadios seem to die with sort of an uproar, which is drastically different from the Aurelianos who tend to die calmly and unnoticeably.
