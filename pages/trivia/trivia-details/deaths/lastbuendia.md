title: Death of Last Buendia
---
Aureliano, the last member of the Buendia clan died just a few hours after his birth. Fascinatingly, he was eaten by the ants while his mother (Amaranta Ursula) died giving birth to him and his father (Aureliano [of sixth genertation]) was deciphering the manuscripts of Mequiades.
