title: Amaranta Ursula and Jose Aureliano's illicit love affair
---
 The love affair between Aureliano Jose and Amaranta is scandalous and is leading towards what the founding matriarch of the Buendia family feared. Amaranta is a virgin who denies any new lover after the suicide of Pietro Crespi. She raised Aureliano Jose son of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, and she used to undress in his presence and sleep with him at night, but as soon as Aureliano Jose entered adolescence he fell in love with her aunt Amaranta. Though Amaranta resists him but she in deep of heart also wants him.
