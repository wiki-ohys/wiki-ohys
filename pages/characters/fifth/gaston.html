    Gaston is Amaranta Ursula's husband whom she married six months before
    coming to Macondo. Gaston loves Amaranta Ursula tremendously and wanted to
    spend their married life in Europe only. He was disappointed when he
    realised that Amaranta would not live anywhere else in the world apart from
    Macondo. She talked of Macondo dearly with nostalgia and declared Macondo as
    the world's most peaceful place to live.
