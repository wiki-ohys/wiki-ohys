    <strong>Founding of Macondo</strong> <hr> 
    <p>
      In his native place José Arcadio Buendía was a cock fighter. He was
      nearly
      one and a half years married to his first cousin <a href="ursula.html">Ursula</a>,
      but he hasn't have a child yet (because of Ursula's fear. <a href="#">read
        more</a> ). The people from village were saying that Ursula is still a
      virgin. José Arcadio Buendía did not like it. One day after he won a
      cockfight against <a href="prudencio.html" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Prudencio Aguilar</a> , Prudencio said
      tauntingly "Maybe that rooster of yours can do your wife a favor." José
      Arcadio Buendía became furious and challenged Prudencio Aguilar to a
      fight to death. José Arcadio Buendía brought his grandfather's spear and
      killed Prudencio Aguilar. After that day Ursula and Jose Arcadio started seeing
      ghost of Prudencio Aguilar in their house. So they decided to leave the
      village for a new place where the ghost will not haunt them. Some young
      men with their families and José Arcadio Buendía decided to cross the
      mountains, and thus they found Macondo.

<strong>Old Age</strong>
<hr>
<p>
  In his old age, Jose Arcadio Buendia started to getting mad. He suffered from demetia, and forgot everything aobut his family and life. He was tied down to a chestnut tree by Ursula where he was provided with food. The image of old Buendia is quite pitiful comparing to his demeaor in his roaring youth. He now utters in Latin only which no one is able to understand but Melquiades.
