<strong>Naming</strong>
<hr>
<p>The Buendia family has a history of naming members on the names of the forefathers, but Amaranta Ursula did not want to name her son the family name because she fears the same solitary fate will consume her child. Regardless of her wishes, Aureliano Babilonia, his father names him Aureliano on the name of his great-great-grandfather Colonel Aureliano Buendia. </p>
