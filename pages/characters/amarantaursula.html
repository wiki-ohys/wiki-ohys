        When Amaranta comes back home Jose Arcadio her brother was already dead.
        The house was in ruins, she doesn't like it and says "it's obvious that
        there's no woman in this house." She take care of the house like her
        great great grand-mother Ursula did. She restored the house back to

  <p class="bodhead">Courtship and Marriage with Gaston</p>
  <p>
    Amaranta Ursula's father Aureliano Segundo had a deep desire that her daugher be educated at the best place. He sent her to Brussels in Europe. There she met Gaston when he was doing a maneouver in airplane. The fell in love and married. 
  </p>
  <p class="bodhead">Relationship with Aureliano Jose</p>
  <p>Aureliano (Babilonia) is Amaranta Ursula's sister's (<a href="renataremedios.html">Renata Remedios Meme's</a>) son with <a href="mauricio.html">Mauricio Babilonia</a>. Fernanda did
    not accept Aureliano as her grandson and got angry with Meme's
    relationship with Mauricio Babilonia, she sent her away and denied her
    grandson to move out of the house. When Amaranta Ursula returned, she
    found him alone in the house and meanwhile living with him alone she
    developed affection for him and Aureliano also fostered love for Amaranta
    Ursula, much like in the past with <a href="../pages/trivia/trivia-pages/buendia-family.html#loveaffair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amaranta and Aureliano Jose</a>. They made love numerous times which resulted in Amaranta Ursula
    pregnancy. Aureliano Jose wanted the child and named his son Aureliano on
    his birth, though the child did not survive. Aurelion the last member of
    Buendia household was born with the pig's tale, so the ancient fear of the
    Buendia Family (see
    <a href="../pages/trivia/trivia-pages/buendia-family.html#ursulas-fear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ursula's Fear</a>) comes to a reality.
  </p>


  <p class="bodhead">Death</p>
  <p>
    Amaranta Ursula dies after giving birth to her son, due to Postpartum
    hemorrhage. She gives birth to a child with a tail of pig. She seems happy
    but Aureliano and the nurse could not get to stop the bleeding after the
    birth and in this way she dies. Aureliano becomes man after her death and
    leaves his son alone in basket which Amaranta made for her child, and ants
    eat his son to death.
