<p>
  When Colonel Aureliano Buendia returned from the war, several women started coming to the Buendia house claiming that Colonel Aureliano Buendía is the father of their children. Ursula calmly took one by one seventeen children in the house and baptised them by the same name "Aureliano". Thus they all named Aureliano.
