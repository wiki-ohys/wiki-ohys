The work on the gallery page could be considered complete. Now the gallery page
1. can show all images from a directory without the need of manual labour. 
2. is responsive and can adjust to different screen sizes.

In the starting days of building this website, I often thought about adding a footer to the website and I successfully created a good sticky footer which remain at the bottom of the page even after scrolling. That remained for a long time until I used plain html to build website. However, since I move the website to Jekyll, that fix kind of stopped working. I had to make a new footer but since everything was so new I could not make one as per my wishes. So I abandoned the idea of having a footer altogether and added the relevant information in the [Licence]({% link pages/license.md %}). Though that did not satisfy my because it was clearly not a replacement of footer.

So, today as I changed the homepage layout to grid from flex, I got an idea and included a footer right-away in the bottom. I am thinking of keeping the footer to the homepage only because clearly making it present everywhere will seem like a little cringe maybe.

Writing update after a long time even though the wiki saw some changes here and there in the meanwhile. But this is just to put in record that lot's of significant changes has been done in this commit.
1. Proper template for Trivia pages
2. Responsive pages for characters
3. Automation of numerous pages (though this change is not visually noticeable this change but I have modified some code so that pages automatically generate. Reducing significant recursive tasks.)
4. Worked on navbar.

Slowly we are moving to a perfect wiki site, where the only remaining task would be to just fill in details which I am more excited about. But designing the website itself is very entertainign and informative.

That's all for today, see you.

Hello Visitor, Since my previous update on the site, I have corrected multiple pages which were broken until now. The homepage is almost complete. Another notable improvement is that, the site has a layout now, and the contents are shown in the set layout. not like previous site where pages have been randomly places and links. However, in the beginning I had something different in mind, like making a site like it is in the 90s, but that is very tiring and confusing.  
I hope to make the characters page fit the layout now, that is another tedious task yet pending, but that is in next in the todo of the site. More updates soon.

I have started reworking on the site. Read the [details here]({% link _posts/2023-08-13-rebuilding-of-the-site.md %})

<div class="updates-date-heading">March 8, 2022</div>

Hello Visitor, Today I've added two new pages, the [trivia page](../pages/trivia/trivia/trivia.md) you can find in the navigation tab on the home page. And, a simple [License cum How-To]({% link pages/license.md %}) page has been placed in the bottom navigation menu. [Amaranta Ursula's]({% link pages/characters/fifth/amarantaursula.html %}) page has been completed good enough. I think. More work to be done. Good day!

Hello Visitor, The site has been added with two pages you see them on the homepage on the right down of the navigation links. They contain a resources page and an image gallery page. These pages will explore further the possibilites of enhancing the knowledge of the book by additional means, like research papers, youtube videos and images. These resources will be immensely helpful to the college students, researchers and professors. More information will be added on regular basis. Thanks!

Hello Visitor, The update is that I've made a page for every character, though the information about the characters is still need to be added. Also some side characters do not have their pages yet which I will add in coming days. I've started adding significant information of every character to their pages and I will add trivia and details as I'll suck more information out of the book. Also added some navigation bar in some pages and overhauled some pages. Bye, See You.

Hi dear reader, Today I've successfully made the template for the character page of this site. Which looks like [this]({% link pages/characters/first/jabuendia.html %}). Also I've done some minor improvments.

Please note that I am working on this site in my free time and a hobby project so I might not write much. If you want to help please [contact me](https://twisthead.github.io).
